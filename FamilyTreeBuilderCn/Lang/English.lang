However, in many cases they indicate that a date field was abused for other information, e.g. to specify a place or a fact not related to a date.

"Info 108",                     "The Gedcom file contains at least one missing mutual reference. A missing mutual reference is a scenario in which one record, such as a Person or a Family, points to another record, but the other record does not point back. Missing mutual references are automatically fixed during the import process."
"Info 2",                       "The Gedcom file contains one or more non-standard custom events. A non-standard custom event is a Gedcom event associated with a person or family, that was apparently entered manually, e.g., ^Struck by lightning^. Such events are fine, but because they are unpredictable, this application will not be able to automatically translate them to other languages, unlike many standard events for which multiple translations are provided."
"Info 3",                       "The Gedcom file contains one or more unrecognized records. An unrecognized record is a record that is not part of the Gedcom specification and is probably proprietary to the Genealogy application that produced the Gedcom file. The use of such records is discouraged. Unrecognized records cannot be imported because their meaning and internal structure are not published."
"Info 4",                       "The Gedcom file contains one or more reused indexes. An index that is used more than once, is a Gedcom index that is incorrectly associated with more than one record. This is a result of a problem in the Genealogy application that produced the Gedcom file. The import will only be able to pick up one record associated with an index; other records that use the same index cannot be imported."
"Info 5",                       "The Gedcom file contains one or more indexes that are referenced but not defined. An index that is referenced but not defined, is an index that is used within the Gedcom file to point to a record, but that record is incorrectly not defined within the Gedcom file. This is a result of a problem in the Genealogy application that produced the Gedcom file. Such indexes are erased during the import process because they are invalid."
"Info 6",                       "The Gedcom file contains one or more bad pointers. A bad pointer in a Gedcom file is a string of text, in a location designated by the Gedcom specification for a pointer, that is not enclosed in '@' characters as required by the specification. This usually means that the Genealogy application that produced the Gedcom file strays from the Gedcom specification."
"Info 7",                       "The Gedcom file contains one or more invalid lines. An invalid line is a line of content in the Gedcom file that does not adhere to the Gedcom specification and cannot be interpreted. Such lines might occur in a Gedcom file that has been partially damaged, or indicate a problem in the Genealogy application that produced the Gedcom file."
"Info 8",                       "The Gedcom file contains one or more unrecognized tags. An unrecognized tag is a field that does not adhere to the Gedcom specification. Some unrecognized tags are proprietary to specific Genealogy applications and their use is permitted. This application will import them, but may not be able to use them according to the exact intent of the application that produced them due to their proprietary nature. Other unrecognized tags are standard Gedcom tags that are simply used incorrectly, in the wrong place or in the wrong way. This, unfortunately, is a common malady of many Genealogy applications. Most typical and common application-specific errors are anticipated by this application and fixed automatically. Those that are reported are not fixed, but are converted to notes if this option is selected in the import wizard."

Information on deceased ancestors can be made available to guests so relatives could find you on the Internet!</li>\n<li>Backup: your data is automatically backed up online each time you publish, and can later be restored.
